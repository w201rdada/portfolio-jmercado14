## Evaluate the Fantasy Landscape

Winning money via daily fantasy sports is a challenge, but 41.5 million people every year are up to the task^1^. Every time that football season approaches, radio and TV channels fill up with ads claiming giant winnings for 24 hours worth of commitment. Draftkings boasts "a new fantasy millionaire every week"^2^, but the reality is that 89.3% of their players lost money across the 2013 and 2014 seasons^3^. In fact, the average fan spends $111 per year on fantasy sports-related bets^1^. The people who come out on top spend hours researching upcoming games, relationships between players, and underpriced prospects just to end up with a positive return on their investment; just 1% of players earn 91% of the overall winnings^4^. How can the average sports fan, with a full time job and a life outside of sports research, possibly come out on top?

## Finalize your Lineup

Fandemonium is the layman's answer to the chaos and danger of the daily fantasy trade. Fandemonium is a Vegas bookie in your pocket; it's an artificial intelligence-enhanced application that analyzes the roster of available players for a given sport, salary per player, current and projected stats, injuries, upcoming games, and more to suggest the draft lineup likely to earn the most points and win you money, given your selected salary cap. Not into football? Fandemonium also prepares recommended rosters for basketball and baseball as well. Have a favorite player that just HAS to be on your roster? You can "lock in" any number of players first, and  Fandemonium will recommend the best combination of players to fill the remaining spots on your roster. With Fandemonium, you don't need to quit your job and study sports analytics full time just to turn a profit - you can let the AI do the math, crunch the numbers, and pick your team for you. 

## Turn Chaos into Cash

Fandemonium pays for itself the first time you  use its expert advice to set your lineup and get a taste of that cash win. On average, Fandemonium users win X% more in a given season than daily fantasy players who do not use our advanced technology. It is worth noting that our application is not magic, and so even its expert recommendations will not be 100% accurate with every prediction. The version of Fandemonium currently available is specifically designed for daily fantasy leagues, and does not support season-long draft contests or rotisserie-style drafts. It also does not support any addtional sports at this time, although we are currently working to support soccer, golf, and hockey leagues.
