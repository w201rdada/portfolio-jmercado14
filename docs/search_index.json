["nfl-play-recommendation-engine.html", "The Coach’s Companion What’s in a play? Making the tough calls Enhance your performance Citations", " The Coach’s Companion Keywords football, american football, machine learning, NFL, recommendation What’s in a play? One play can be the difference between a win or a loss in American football (just ask the 2014 Seahawks Superbowl team1). In the 2016 NFL season, teams averaged 64 plays per game2, meaning that on average, teams only have ~1,024 plays every season with which to create a championship-winning team (or a championship-losing one). Given each individual play’s importance, making the correct decision with each play becomes a high-stakes endeavor. Coaches and quarterbacks have to fight time constraints, a roaring crowd, competing opinions from other coaching staff, and their own biases to make the best possible play call for their team in that moment. In reality, 40 seconds between each play3 just isn’t enough for a coach or quarterback to evaluate all possible options and make the best decision considering the circumstances of that particular game. Making the tough calls Enter the Coach’s Companion - a tool designed to help North American football organizations (specifically those within the NFL) make the best play call at any given time during a game. The Coach’s Companion has access to the last three years of NFL play data, including in-game time, score differential, distance to first down, distance to goal, opposing team defensive stats, and possessing team quarterback stats for every play run in regular season games. In stadiums enhanced with video tracking, it also marks the opposing team’s position on the field to analyze their defensive line. The Companion keeps track of the status of your current game, compares your current game situation to similar historical ones, and then recommends the offensive play option that is most likely to lead to a first down, scoring position, or optimal defensive position (if punting). As soon as one play is over, the Companion has already recommended the next type of play to make, freeing up coaches and QBs to spend their 40 seconds on strategy and effective communication of the specific run, pass, or punt play that works best for their team. The Companion also continues to collect play data and retrain its algorithms over time, meaning that it will continue to get smarter and make more intelligent recommendations as the teams and league evolve. Enhance your performance The Coach’s Companion has proven to be an invaluable asset to on-the-ground coaching staffs as they make quick, high-pressure decisions in-game. Rather than taking the power out of the coach’s hands, the Companion provides him or her the best tools with which to use that power. And it works - teams that use the Coach’s Companion and follow its recommendations at least 75% of the time have improved their win percentage by an average of X percentage points, and have improved their game overall point total by an average of Y points. While the Companion is currently limited to offensive play recommendations only, future enhancements to the product will add defensive play recommendations to its repertoire. No app will ever replace a coach’s intuition, but the Companion can provide an extra level of certainty to any game-time decision. With ever-increasing amounts of game and play data available, it only makes sense to give coaches and teams the best decision-making tools around.

["turning-fantasy-draft-chaos-into-cash.html", "Fandemonium Evaluate the Fantasy Landscape Finalize your Lineup Turn Chaos into Cash Bibliography", " Fandemonium Keywords fantasy sports, fantasy draft, daily fantasy, machine learning, predictive analytics Evaluate the Fantasy Landscape The object of the typical daily fantasy league is simple: given a set salary, draft the best possible roster and hope that your team scores more points than your opponents’ teams to win cash. The process seems easy enough for 41.5 million people to give it a shot each year1. Every time that football season approaches, radio and TV channels fill up with ads claiming giant winnings for 24 hours worth of commitment. Draftkings boasts “a new fantasy millionaire every week”2, but the reality is that 89.3% of their players lost money across the 2013 and 2014 seasons3. The people who come out on top spend hours researching upcoming games, relationships between players, and underpriced prospects just to end up with a positive return on their investment; just 1% of players earn 91% of the overall winnings4. How can the average sports fan, with a full time job and a life outside of sports research, possibly come out on top? Finalize your Lineup Fandemonium is the layman’s answer to the chaos and danger of the daily fantasy trade. Fandemonium is a Vegas bookie in your pocket; it’s an artificial intelligence-enhanced mobile and web app that harnesses the power of predictive analytics to analyze the roster of available players for a given sport, salary per player, current and projected stats, current injuries, upcoming games, and more to suggest the draft lineup likely to earn the most points and win you money. Not into football? Fandemonium prepares recommended rosters for basketball and baseball as well. Have a favorite player that just HAS to be on your roster? You can “lock in” any number of players first, and Fandemonium will recommend the best combination of players to fill the remaining spots on your roster. With Fandemonium, you don’t need to quit your job and study sports analytics full time just to turn a profit - you can let the AI do the math, crunch the numbers, and pick your team for you. Turn Chaos into Cash Fandemonium pays for itself the first time you use its expert advice to set your lineup and get a taste of that cash win. On average, Fandemonium users win X% more often and Y% more cash in a given season than daily fantasy players who do not use our advanced technology. It is worth noting that our application is not magic, and so even its expert recommendations will not be 100% accurate with every prediction. The version of Fandemonium currently available is specifically designed for daily fantasy leagues, and does not support season-long draft contests or rotisserie-style drafts. Future releases of the app will support soccer, golf, and hockey daily leagues.
